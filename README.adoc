== Introduction

This application was created to showcase how to configure Logging, Metrics, and Tracing in a Quarkus and collect and manage them using the supported infrastructure of Openshift.

The application was built using https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus], a Container-First framework for writing Java applications.

=== Openshift Components

In order to collect the logs, metrics, and traces from our application, we are going to deploy and configure several Openshift components. The installation and configuration of the components are not the focus of this repository, so I will provide links to my other repositories where I have my quickstarts for those components.

| Openshift Component
| Purpose

| https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/distr_tracing/distr_tracing_arch/distr-tracing-architecture.html[ OpenShift distributed tracing]
| Collect and display distributed traces. It is based on https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] and https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry].

| https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/monitoring/monitoring-overview.html[User Workload Monitoring]
| Collect metrics in https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics[OpenMetrics] format from user workloads and present it in the built-in dashboard. It also allows the creation of alerts based on metrics.

| https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/logging/cluster-logging.html[Cluster Logging Operator]
| Collect, store, and visualize logs from workloads.
